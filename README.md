# 🔐 Android Security Labs

## 📖 About 

This repository contains a set of vulnerable Android applications created to **teach Android security** through hands-on labs.  
Each lab includes a specific type of vulnerability and a hidden **flag**. Your goal is to identify and exploit the issue to retrieve the flag.

🎯 This project is valuable for:
- 👨‍💻 **Android Developers** — to learn how to avoid common security flaws when building apps.
- 🕵️ **Android Pentesters** — to practice identifying and exploiting real-world vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

## 🎯 Your Objective

Each lab contains a **hidden flag**. If you can extract the flag, it means you've successfully understood and exploited the vulnerability ✅  
This is a great way to build your mobile security skills step-by-step.
